In front of the castle is the castle square. The palace gardens begin directly behind the palace.
The palace, including the square and garden, does not belong to the city of Karlsruhe, but to the state of Baden-Württemberg.
It houses the Baden State Museum and the castle café. The castle tower offers a very good view of the Karlsruhe fan. In order to be able to experience this, however, 158 steps in the castle tower have to be overcome.
In October 2013, the castle was completely scaffolded for a comprehensive facade and roof renovation. The state is investing four million euros in the measures.
The scaffolding is expected to be dismantled again in March 2015 and thus before the extensive celebrations on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the city.
In addition to optical measures, porous sandstone and rotten wood must be replaced. The previous facade renovation took place in 1988.
